## Laravel Zero Foundation

This is a mirror of `src/Illuminate/Foundation` from [Laravel Framework](https://github.com/laravel/framework).

## Notes

In this package, `Illuminate\Foundation\Application` class doesn't implement `Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\HttpKernelInterface` interface.

Also in this package, the `Console\Kernel::load()` method does not use the canonicalized absolute path to the `app` directory.
